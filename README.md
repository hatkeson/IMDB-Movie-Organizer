# IMDB-Movie-Organizer
This program prompts the user for a movie title (required) and a year (optional) and searches IMDB with those parameters. 
It then displays information about the results, including: 
* Title
* Alternate Titles
* Director
* Year
* Runtime

The user is then given the option to add information on what format they own the title in and what release studio it's from, and export the results to a SQLite database.
The user can later search this list by any combination of the following: title, director, year, or decade. The program can also randomly choose a single film from these results
